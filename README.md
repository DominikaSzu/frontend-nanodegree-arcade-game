### Rules

This arcade game consists of a game playground, enemies and the player. 

To run the game, you should just move your character :) The player can go:
* up
* down
* left
* right 

It can be moved by clicking on arrow keys on the keyboard. The player can move only on the game playground and has to reach the water to get a point. 

The player has to avoid enemies. If it collides with the enemy, he gets back to starting point and loses one point.

More points you get, faster the enemies move.

If you wish, you can also change the character and get a new, random one!

Have fun :)
